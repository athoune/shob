SHOB, gateway for using http server as a XMPP client
====================================================

Early works, just a proof of concept for now.

The gateway is in nodejs, and the client in what you want.
Examples will be done in ruby (sinatra), python(bottle) and php

Try it
------

	cd client/bottle
	./client.py

In an other shell

	cd server
	node test.js my_jid my_password
